      <SampleResponse response="I strongly prefer studying in groups for two main reasons. First, group study sessions expose me to different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. When my classmates explain concepts in their own words, I often understand the material better than when reading it alone. For instance, during my chemistry course, a study partner's explanation of molecular bonds finally made the concept click for me. Second, studying with others keeps me accountable and motivated. It's easy to procrastinate when studying alone, but when I've committed to meeting my study group, I'm much more likely to actually prepare and stay focused." />
